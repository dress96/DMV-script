# FiveM - Driving license exam script

This is a first script where I learn the basic concept use the in LUA languaje and how this implemented in Fivem platform and praticing basic concepts to create a NUI in fivem using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 

This script don't include a typical fivem roleplay driving test or pratical test only a more realistic driving test simulating a driving teacher who give a instrucction to do the test and the direction on the road that you must take. Finish the test, this give the respective driving license depent of which you have chosen to do.

As for the summary characteristics, they are the following:

- Only use in ESX frameword but you can modific to use in QBus Framework if you want. 
- Don't include driving test exam only the practise part.
- The practise part is more realistic a diference or another automatic DMV script.
- It has been optimized although it can be even more.
- Only traslation Spanish in locale folder but you can create your own traduction.

**Because it is a script that has been little tested, it may have errors or bugs that I am not going to fix in the future since the project was a practice project and not a long-term one compared to others that I am doing.**
